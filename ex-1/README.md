# The fortune Teller

Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.

Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids." where the variables contain text of your choosing.

Output the same text to the console. Hint --> console.log
